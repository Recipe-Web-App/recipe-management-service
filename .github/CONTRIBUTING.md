## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recipe-management-service.git
   cd recipe-management-service
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Recipe-Web-App/recipe-management-service.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 (OpenJDK or Eclipse Temurin)
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+ (for local development)
- Git
- Your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Initial Setup

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your local configuration
   ```

3. **Start development environment**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:

   ```bash
   mvn flyway:migrate
   ```

5. **Run the service**:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Run tests frequently**:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** following commit guidelines

5. **Keep your branch updated**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Testing

This project uses a multi-layered testing strategy as defined in CLAUDE.md.

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
mvn test

# Unit tests only (90% coverage requirement)
mvn test -Dgroups="unit"

# Component tests (with Testcontainers)
mvn test -Dgroups="component"

# Integration tests (Karate API tests)
mvn test -Dgroups="dependency"

# Performance tests (JMeter)
mvn verify

# Single test class
mvn test -Dtest=RecipeServiceTest
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
mvn test jacoco:report

# View report at: target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Required for all new code, 90% coverage minimum
- **Component tests**: Required for service layer changes
- **Integration tests**: Required for API endpoint changes
- **Performance tests**: Required for performance-critical features

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD encouraged)
- Use Datafaker for realistic test data
- Follow the AbstractComponentTest pattern for component tests
- Mock repositories, use real services in component tests
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Test security implications

## Code Style

This project enforces strict code quality standards.

### Formatting

```bash
# Check formatting
mvn spotless:check

# Apply formatting
mvn spotless:apply
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks
mvn checkstyle:check spotbugs:check pmd:check

# Individual checks
mvn checkstyle:check  # Google Java Style
mvn spotbugs:check    # Bug detection
mvn pmd:check         # Code analysis
```

### Style Guidelines

- Follow Google Java Style Guide
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add JavaDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep methods small and focused
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- Use Spring Boot best practices
- Follow JPA/Hibernate best practices

### IDE Setup

**IntelliJ IDEA:**

- Install Google Java Format plugin
- Import code style from `.editorconfig`
- Enable "Optimize imports on the fly"

**Eclipse:**

- Install Eclipse Code Formatter
- Import formatter settings from project
