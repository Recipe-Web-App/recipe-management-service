# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the previous three months |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the
security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
**<security@recipe-manager.com>** (replace with your actual security contact)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not,
please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can
provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible
issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Update Process

1. **Report received**: We confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
   within 48 hours.
2. **Initial triage**: We perform initial triage within 5 business days.
3. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the vulnerability.
4. **Fix development**: We develop and test a fix.
5. **Security advisory**: We prepare a security advisory.
6. **Release**: We release the fix and publish the security advisory.
7. **Credit**: We acknowledge your contribution (if desired).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always use the latest version of the Recipe Manager Service
- Use strong, unique passwords for database connections
- Implement proper network security (firewalls, VPNs)
- Regularly update dependencies and base images
- Monitor security advisories and CVE databases
- Enable logging and monitoring for security events

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use automated security scanning tools
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regularly review and audit code for security issues

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password hashing with BCrypt
- Session management

### Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection where applicable

### Infrastructure Security

- Container security best practices
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal container images
- Security headers implementation

### Monitoring & Logging

- Security event logging
- Request tracking and tracing
- Audit trails
- Performance monitoring

## Security Tools & Scanning

This project includes:

- **Static Code Analysis**: SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle
- **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP Dependency Check
- **Container Scanning**: Planned integration
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube integration (if available)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability report received
- **Day 1**: Confirmation of receipt sent to reporter
- **Day 5**: Initial triage completed
- **Day 14**: Fix development begins (for confirmed vulnerabilities)
- **Day 30**: Target date for fix release (may vary based on complexity)
- **Day 30+**: Security advisory published

## Security Contact Information

- **Security Email**: <security@recipe-manager.com> (replace with actual contact)
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for initial response
- **Escalation**: If no response within 72 hours, please contact the project
  maintainers directly
