### URL Structure

All requests use the correct URL structure: `{{baseUrl}}/api/v1/recipe-management/*`

## Environment Setup

### 1. Import Files

1. Import `Recipe-Management-Service.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. Import both environment files into Postman

### 2. Create Private Environment Files

The environment files contain placeholder passwords. Create private versions:

```bash
# Copy environment files with -Private suffix
cp Recipe-Management-Local.postman_environment.json Recipe-Management-Local-Private.postman_environment.json
cp Recipe-Management-Development.postman_environment.json Recipe-Management-Development-Private.postman_environment.json
```

### 3. Add Real Credentials

Edit your `-Private` files and replace:

- `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TEST_USER_PASSWORD` → Your actual test user password
- `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` → Your actual admin user password

### 4. Import Private Environments

Import your `-Private.postman_environment.json` files into Postman (these are
automatically gitignored).

## Environment Variables
